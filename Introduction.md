# Introduction

The better question is which computer classes have I not taken. The two classes that I haven't taken for computer science is Discrete & Continuous Computer Algorithms and my Senior Project. I'm familiar with java, html, css, basic knowledge of php, javascript, and jquery. I've used coding programs such as eclipse, blueJ, texteditor 3, and netbeans.

I will most likely be using everything I learn in this class to help develop websites or help maintain them. This class will also help open my eyes to new languages and ways to solve different problems that I have  yet to solve.
